      <p>Thank you so much for visiting my web site! This project shows off my relatively new-found skills - both in cooking and in coding! Hopefully, though, it reflects my growing love of both.<br>
      
        That's my wife and me in the picture, and we live in Louisville, Kentucky, where I currently work at a local high school. 
        However, this web site was born out of new experiences in both coding and cooking. 
        My passion for cooking started out simply with one of those services that sends you meal ingredients and recipes. 
        Up to that point, recipes had seemed so daunting, but these meals were actually kind of fun to make. 
        And, I found myself loving the result!
        Even after cancelling this meal service (once the promos were up!) I still enjoyed trying my hand at new and exciting recipes, and this web site reflects my own desire to expand my horizons in the culinary world!<br>
      
      
        Similarly, coding always seemed so foreign and impossible to me - like some kind of magic.
        I knew people made web sites and apps that did amazing things, but it just seemed like another language. 
        Well, I found out it was!
        At a pivotal point in my life, I decided to end my career in Sterile Processing (sterilizing surgical equipment at a hospital) in order to pursue... something else. 
        As I was looking at what I could do, a friend told me about Code Louisville. 
        Why not? 
        But as I started learning more about this new languages (or new <i>languages</i>), I realized I was fascinated with what I was learning. 
        Now, a semester into Code Louisville, I am thrilled to have designed a web site like this, and I am excited to see what's next both in cooking and coding!
