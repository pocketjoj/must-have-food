Hello and thank you for your interest in my project! You can simply navigate to https://pocketjoj.github.io/must-have-food/ in order to access my web page. The site, in all of its splendour, is hosted there and is as functional as I can make it, currently.

Just a few things to note: 

1. This project is NOT finished. Some of the pages are blank (like the "Find a Recipe" page), and some of the buttons are dummy buttons currently; I am hoping to use a free recipe API on this page that will let me actually build in the recipe database and meal planner components that I want to do, but the project as of now is a front-end shell for my eventual glorious finished project. 

2. For that reason, while JavaScript is powering some items and actions on this page (pulling up/dismissing forms, etc.) the feedback items are actually not submitting anywhere just yet. 

3. I would LOVE your feedback on anything that is good, bad or ugly. If you notice sloppy or redundant code, please let me know. If you notice a particularly elegant feature, nothing would bring a smile to my face like hearing about it. You can reach me at jdbenge7@gmail.com


I hope you enjoy looking through this project, and (once again) thanks for your interest and any feedback you're willing to give!

Sincerely,
Joel
